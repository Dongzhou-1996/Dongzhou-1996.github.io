To study the problems of stability analysis of non-linear system with time-delay, this paper focuses on the stability analysis of T-S fuzzy system with constant time-delay. By constructing a new type of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing integral inequality method based on Legendre orthogonal polynomials, a new stability criterion with less conservatism has proposed. Numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
